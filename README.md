# Pomodoro Timer ReactJS ‚öõ

The Pomodoro technique is a method used to study, work, or what you need to do, that helps to concentrate in small intervals of time.

 The technique consists on setting a 25 minutes (but you can make it more) timer and at the end of the cycle you make a 5 minutes pause, every 4 cycles you make a longer pause of 10 or 15 minutes. It's a helpful technique that can really help people that can't concentrate for long periods of time ‚è±üí§

## What i made and what i used

 In this project i developed a timer where you can especify the task you are working on and the time of your cycle, you can even see your history of cycles, how long ago that cycle was ad if it was completed, interrupted or if it's on progress. I used **ReactJS + Vite + TypeScript** , the project was really helpfull so i could lern more about React Hooks like **useState**, **useEffect**, **useReduce**, **useContext**, **useForm**, and other React techniques.
 
 If you're tying the App follow the steps bellow ‚¨á‚¨á
